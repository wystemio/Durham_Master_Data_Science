## Marks for ISDS Assignment 2 From Sarah Heaps

Hi All, 

Your marks for ISDS Assignment 2 have been published; I'm so sorry for the delay, but one of the markers was quite poorly over Christmas. 

A summary of the distribution of marks is here: 

Minimum Median Maximum Mean Standard Deviation 
8.0 62.5 95.0 61.23 17.52 

I know that many of you found this module difficult, so well done for your continued efforts. This assignment carries most of the marks for the module so I understand that some of you may have concerns about what your mark means going forward. I’ve put together a few comments on this below, but I’m happy to discuss further during my office hour on Thursday 19th January, 15:00 - 16:00. (My office is room MCS3016 on the third floor of the Maths and Computer Science Building.) 

1. All marks are provisional until ratified by a Board of Examiners (BoE), and the BoE has options available to it when considering mark distributions within a specific assessment if they very clearly do not match up with mark distributions across the entire year. 

2. Students who do not pass a module are entitled to resit that module’s exam in the summer. Since this module does not have an exam, this entitlement is interpreted to mean you would be able to attempt a new version of Assignment 2. Generally speaking, students failing the assignment but passing the module would not attempt a new version of the assignment, with the circumstances related to the failure of this assignment taken into account by the BoE. 

3. If you feel you did not do as well as you could have on the assignment due to extenuating circumstances, there are routes you can take in response. Discussion with your College Support Officer (check your college’s website for contact details) and consideration of the SAC process may be helpful if you experienced an unexpected issue. Discussion with Disability Support may be helpful if you have recently been diagnosed with a long-term condition, or if a previously diagnosed condition has recently worsened. 

I hope this additional context is useful to you. As mentioned, I would be happy to discuss further. 

You were a lovely class to teach and I wish you every success with the remainder of your degree here at Durham! 

All the best, 

Sarah
